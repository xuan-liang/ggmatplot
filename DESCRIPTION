Description: A quick and easy way of plotting two matrices against each other 
    using ggplot2. Can also be used as an alternative to pivoting data into long
    format before plotting, by using the index column(s) and the columns to be 
    plotted against the index as the two matrix inputs for 'ggmatplot'.
